# Nested Loops in Python

# Example 1: Nested for loops
for i in range(1, 4):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(1, 4):  # Inner loop
        print(f"Farooq: i = {i}, j = {j}")

# Example 2: Nested while loops
i = 1
while i <= 3:  # Outer loop
    j = 1
    while j <= 3:  # Inner loop
        print(f"Farooq: i = {i}, j = {j}")
        j += 1
    i += 1

# Example 3: Combining for and while loop
for i in range(1, 4):
    j = 1
    while j <= 2:
        print(f"Farooq: i = {i}, j = {j}")
        j += 1
